/**
 * The `<platinum-sw-offline-analytics>` element registers a service worker handler to
 * intercept requests for Google Analytics pings.
 *
 * If the HTTP GET for the ping is successful (because the browser is online), then everything
 * proceeds as it normally would. If the HTTP GET fails, the ping request is saved to IndexedDB, and each time the service worker
 * script starts up it will attempt to "replay" those saved ping requests, giving up after one day
 * has passed.
 *
 * The [`qt`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#qt)
 * URL parameter is automatically added to the replayed HTTP GET and set to the number of
 * milliseconds that has passed since the initial ping request was attempted, to ensure that the
 * original time attribution is correct.
 *
 * `<platinum-sw-offline-analytics>` does not take care of setting up Google Analytics on your
 * page, and assumes that you have [properly configured](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080)
 * the Google Analytics tracking code registered elsewhere on your page.
 *
 * Since `<platinum-sw-offline-analytics>` is only useful if the page that is being tracked with
 * Google Analytics works offline, it's best used in conjunction with the `<platinum-sw-cache>`
 * element, which takes care of caching your site's resources and serving them while offline.
 *
 * A basic configuration is
 *
 *     <platinum-sw-register auto-register>
 *       <platinum-sw-offline-analytics></platinum-sw-offline-analytics>
 *       <platinum-sw-cache></platinum-sw-cache>
 *     </platinum-sw-register>
 *
